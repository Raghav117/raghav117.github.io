    <h1>Privacy Policy for Emergency Location</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 3, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
        Emergency Location is designed to help users <strong>share their current location</strong> with
        pre-selected contacts during emergencies. The app <strong>does not require internet</strong>
        and uses <strong>SMS</strong> to send the location. This is done <strong>only when the user
            taps the notification</strong>, ensuring complete user control.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Permissions We Use and Why</h2>

    <h3>a. <code>ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION</code></h3>
    <p>
        This permission allows the app to access your deviceâ€™s location even when running in the background.
        It is only used when you <strong>tap the emergency notification</strong> to send your current location
        to trusted contacts.
    </p>

    <h3>b. <code>SEND_SMS</code></h3>
    <p>
        This permission is used to <strong>send your location via SMS</strong> to contacts you have selected.
        No SMS is sent automatically or without your confirmation.
    </p>

    <h3>c. <code>SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW</code></h3>
    <p>
        This permission allows us to show emergency controls (like floating buttons or overlays) on top
        of other apps. This ensures that you can quickly send your location even in critical situations.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Collection and Internet Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do <strong>not collect or store</strong> any personal data, contacts, or messages.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not use internet</strong> access at all.</li>
        <li>All data processing happens <strong>locally</strong> on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Control</h2>
    <p>
        You can manage permissions anytime via your device settings. Location and SMS are accessed
        <strong>only with your consent</strong> and <strong>only when you tap the emergency notification</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your data never leaves your device except through the SMS message you choose to send.
        We do not track, log, or store any data on servers.
    </p>
